# 116048-Sets-3D-Handpose-Dataset

## Description
This dataset contains 116,048 sets of 3D handpose data, each set includes hand mask image(RGB, 24-bit), depth image(16-bit), camera intrinsic parameter file(TXT), 3D keypoints file(OBJ), mesh file(OBJ), gesture type file(TXT), keypoints demo image(JPG), and mesh demo image(JPG). The data is collected indoors, with the right hand (no handheld objects), covering both first-person and third-person perspectives, multiple gesture types, finger poses, hand overall rotation poses, individuals and Kinect devices used. This dataset does not include personally identifiable facial information, with hand mask images and depth images aligned. This dataset can be used for tasks such as handpose recognition, hand 3D reconstruction, and hand keypoints detection.
